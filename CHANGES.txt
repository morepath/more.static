CHANGES
*******

0.7 (unreleased)
================

- Nothing changed yet.


0.6 (2014-11-15)
================

- Use BowerStatic 0.7, which makes Tween-based integration much
  simpler.

- There was a bug where references were injected but not actually
  properly published.

0.5 (2014-11-13)
================

- It is no longer necessary to wrap the application with Bower using
  WSGI. Instead a tween is used. To migrate, simply replace the
  following::

    wsgi = bower.wrap(App())
    morepath.run(wsgi)

  With this::

    morepath.run(App())

- Requires Morepath 0.8 and Bowerstatic 0.6.

0.4 (2014-11-03)
================

- Adjust to handle Morepath 0.7 API changes concerning request
  construction.

0.3 (2014-09-08)
================

- The 0.2 introduced a ``component`` method to obtain a component object
  and thus its URL. This didn't turn out to be compatible with local
  components, so I've changed it to ``get_component`` instead::

    request.static_components.get_component('jquery').url()

- Depend on version 0.4 of BowerStatic.

0.2 (2014-08-28)
================

- Make available a ``static_components`` property on the request,
  which is a BowerStatic static components object. You can use
  this primarily to get the URL to a component, like this::

    request.static_components.component('jquery').url()

- Depend on version 0.3 of BowerStatic.

0.1 (2014-07-07)
================

- Initial public release.
